# Welcome to Materials Galaxy!

{:.no_toc}
<br>
The **Materials Galaxy** workbench is the place to go for anything materials science in Galaxy! The workbench is based on the [Galaxy framework](https://galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"},
which guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses independent of command-line knowledge.
