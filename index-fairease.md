# Welcome to Galaxy for Fair-Ease
{:.no_toc}
<br>
**Galaxy for Fair-Ease** ([Fair-Ease](https://fairease.eu/){:target="_blank"}) is a virtual platform to process, analyse and visualize Earth System, Environment and Biodiversity data. It is based on the [Galaxy framework](https://galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"}, which guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses independent of command-line knowledge.

# Get started

Are you new to Galaxy, or returning after a long time, and looking for help to get started? Take a [__guided tour__]({{ page.website }}/tours/core.galaxy_ui){:target="_blank"} through Galaxy's user interface.


# Training

We are working in close collaboration with the [__Galaxy Training Network (GTN)__](https://training.galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"} to develop training materials of data analyses based on Galaxy. If you want to know more about the GTN or how to become part of the Galaxy community, check the videos below!

# Tools

Multiple tools on Earth System, Environment and Biodiversity data analysis will be available in this custom Galaxy instance:

- **General tools**
    - Interactive tools : Jupyterlab
    - Data viewer : WebODV
- **Ocean tools**
    - Source and DIVAnd
- **Bio_geo chemical dedicated tools**
- **Etmo BON (biodiversity) tools**
- **EAZ earth analytical zone tools** on desertification
- **Volcanic plume dedicated tools**

# Workflows

To orchestrate tools and help users with their analyses, several [workflows](https://galaxyproject.org/learn/advanced-workflow/){:target="_blank"} will be available. They formally orchestrate tools in a defined order and with defined parameters, but they are customizable (tools, order, parameters).
