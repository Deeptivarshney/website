Welcome to **Galaxy for Genome Annotation** -- a platform to annotate, curate, and publish genomic data

From [annotation.usegalaxy.eu](https://annotation.usegalaxy.eu/), you can easily run state-of-the-art workflows to annotate genome sequences, and explore your results with modern visualisations (see below).

You also have access to a self-service [Apollo](https://github.com/GMOD/apollo) server, offering you a free technical infrastructure to set up in minutes your own project of manual curation of annotation for your favorite genome.

Have a look at the [training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/genome-annotation/) to learn how to use these tools!

These resources have been produced by GGA community who works on a group of projects focused on supporting genome annotation inside Galaxy, in particular:

- Galaxy tools and workflows
- Training material
- Docker images for GMOD applications
- Python libraries to interact with GMOD applications
- Apollo tooling and service

Checkout the [GGA website](https://galaxy-genome-annotation.github.io/) for more details, and feel free to chat with us on our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxy-genome-annotation_Lobby:gitter.im).

GGA was also [presented at ISMB/ECCB 2019!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hJyI1sbfxAzzgoJ5E4eHNicSbYzBDaVwTwfOlOLiV3c/edit?usp=sharing)
