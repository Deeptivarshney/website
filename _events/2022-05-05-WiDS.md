We are delighted to welcome you to the 3rd "Women in Data Science - Perspectives in Industry and Academia" event, which will take place virtually on 18th May 2022 from 3:00 - 5:30 pm (CEST). This year we have gained the Bioinfo4Women at our side, an initiative from the Life Sciences department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Barcelona, Spain) working in close collaboration with ELIXIR Spain with the aim to promote the research done by women in computational biology.
