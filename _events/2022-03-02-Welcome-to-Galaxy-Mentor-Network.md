The last 13 weeks have been spent with Outreachy interns, Chinonye Mildred Egenti and Rahmot Afolabi, under the mentorship of Bérénice Batut and Assunta DeSanto to create the Galaxy Mentor Network and her mentoring program. A launch event is holding on the 3rd of March, 2022 (online) with a special Questions and Answers session to get everyone informed about this amazing opportunity to mentor community members and to be mentored.
