### Agenda
Each tutorial is divided into 3 sessions:
* **Training session** is [a zoom meeting](https://uni-freiburg.zoom.us/j/69564802900?pwd=cjZQWjFQVEYxUStCbitXRDdFdGdaQT09) where I will present the basic idea of the topic and demonstrate the data analysis on Galaxy and explain each analysis step. It is a popcorn session. Participants should relax, watch and ask questions.
* **Hands-on session** is the work-session. Participants will perform the analysis that they have learned during the training session. The training materials are provided. All the questions during the hands-on session will be answered by me in [a SIGNAL group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIH6KglJTodpulsUflQDHyEEURMaxPWfaDvbpG0hop4XJEhCmmjxMoz_8UJy0hI6SZCFP). All the training information and training material will stay online even after the training.
* **Q&A session**: Day ends with an extended live discussion on zoom where we all can discuss any remaining questions about the topic. This session will start at 16:30.

I encourage you to start the analysis of your own data after completing the tutorials.

## Preparation
Some important steps to consider before joining the training:

1. For the training, all you need is a computer with a latest web browser.
2. Galaxy interactive tours guide you stepwise through the Galaxy user interface
and the history. They will help you to follow the Galaxy introduction, and
ensure everyone has a basic understanding of how Galaxy works. It is recommended
to go through the following two Galaxy interactive tours before beginning the
 training, but it is not mandatory.
    - [Galaxy UI](https://usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui)
    - [History Introduction](https://usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.history)
