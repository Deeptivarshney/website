This course is aimed at researchers with little-to-no experience in big data analysis who are generating, planning on generating, or working with single-cell RNA sequencing data.

After this course you should be able to:

- Explain the steps in the scRNA-seq pipeline
- Repeat the course analysis of scRNA-seq data from extraction to trajectories
- Recognise decision-making steps along the analysis pipeline and justify your decisions, from experimental design to final visualisation

The [application](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/single-cell-rna-seq-analysis-using-galaxy-0/#vf-tabs__section--tab3) is open until November 27th.
