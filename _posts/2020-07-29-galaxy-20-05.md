We've updated our Galaxy server to **version 20.05**. This version includes the **migration to Python 3** and improves usability in the aspects listed below.


For a full list of the new features
please refer to the release notes of versions [20.01](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/20.01_announce_user.html) and [20.05](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/20.05_announce_user.html).


### Tool Recommendations

When you add a tool to your workflow in [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), you can now get a recommendation on which tools you can run next. This [feature](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2019/06/27/tool-prediction/) applies machine learning to data based on the previous usage and was already deployed on the European Galaxy server since a year - now this feature was integrated into the upstream code and works better than ever.
