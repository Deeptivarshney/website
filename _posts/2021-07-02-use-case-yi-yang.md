[__Yi Yang, PhD__](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1131-6196) has shared with us how Galaxy is used at the [Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (China)](http://english.iae.cas.cn/). 

> Thanks for the shared resources and publicly available great tools, which have been very helpful to our research. My research focus is the genomics, evolution, and ecology of organohalide-respiring bacteria. We have used the resources for sequencing analysis, and these tools are very important for those (the layman) who do not have programming skills but require hands-on bioinformatics analysis. The embedded pipelines are especially useful.
