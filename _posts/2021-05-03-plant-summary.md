We thank everyone for their support during the [__Plant Transcriptome Analysis using Galaxy__](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y5MqYmMxFCy7PDImYYuHLhgCKVV7MjoGMr22G2U68Ec/preview) workshop that took place online in the week of the 19th of April. The workshop offered a complete crash course in Galaxy and built towards __miRNA and single-cell RNA topics__ that were tailored for _Arabidopsis_ genomes.

# Plants flavour: [plants.usegalaxy.eu](https://plants.usegalaxy.eu/)

A [__special flavour of the European Galaxy Server__](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2020/12/28/subdomains/) was set up for this workshop, filtering the tools by their relevance to the plant research field.

# Format

To better empower those who require more flexible time schedules, the workshop was designed in an asynchronous way: recordings and tutorials were made available online for the participants to consume at their own pace. After the workshop, the __tutorials will stay available in the GTN and the recordings on the [Galaxy Project YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA)__.

During the training week, __24 experts from different time zones were available in chat__ to answer the questions. A huge shout out to all of them for the support!

# Participation

Participants attended from __all over the globe__, enabled by the flexible learning resources provided, with a particular interest in the RNA-based tutorials available in the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/).

The registration was over 460 participants and close to 200 join the chat platform. The __career stage__ by country indicates enrichment in postgraduates, master and PhD students.

# Feedback

Despite the limitations of the online settings and the occasional questions in chat, the videos on YouTube were popular with around __1700 views__ and __183 hours of watch time__.

In the feedback survey, participants indicated that the training was useful, met their expectations and was well organised. In terms of the format, there seems to be a slightly higher preference for videos than only tutorials.

The general missing piece was the lack of face-to-face interaction. We got some nice comments about what was the best part of the workshop:

* _“Overall comment: great job! Given the difficult times we are living in, this was great!”_
* _(The best thing about this workshop is) “that you could do everything at your own pace, some days I had lab work but I could still start in the afternoon or evening. This was very nice.”_
* _“The tutorial text and the videos are great. Each one complements the other. The galaxy platform was friendly too. I can remember the commands/tools lesson by lesson. Also, the availability of the materials after the workshop is great!!”_
