After two intense weeks of training, conference and collaboration fest, the [__Galaxy Community Conference 2021 (GCC2021)__](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) has come to an end. This has been the second virtual GCC since the pandemic started and it has featured a week of training, a three-day conference and a two-day CoFest. In total, __399 participants from 55 countries__ attended any of these events.

## Training Week

The [__training week__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/) ran from June 28 through July 2. Three different tracks were offered for __scientists__, __developers__ and __admins__. All the lectures were prerecorded, captioned and the experts provided live support in chat or in [remo](https://remo.co/) when needed. This format allowed the participants to learn at their own pace, and everything is still available! Check the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) and the [GCC2021 training page](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/).

## Conference

The main goal of the Galaxy Community conference is to bring together the community to share our work and address common challenges in data-intensive science, with a special focus on networking. To make it truly global, the [schedule](https://gcc2021.sched.com/) ran twice every day shifted by 9 hours. We had, in total, __53 talks, 59 speakers, 44 posters/demos and 17 Birds of a Feather (BoF)__.

On the __first day__, the different sessions addressed [current challenges (COVID, Biodiversity)](https://gcc2021.sched.com/event/ih0L/emea-apac-session-1), [Galaxy administration](https://gcc2021.sched.com/event/ih0U/emea-apac-session-2) and [Workflows](https://gcc2021.sched.com/event/ih0j/emea-apac-session-3).

Between days 1 and 2, several BoFs took place:
- [Galaxy & Bioinformatics in Africa](https://gcc2021.sched.com/event/kBmc/bof-galaxy-bioinformatics-in-africa)

## CoFest

The three-day conference was followed by a __two-day collaborative work event__ to expand the contributor community. This year, the CoFest was organized around [clusters ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0L4mc7s2JOx0uq6HGP3QE3V5Za20GfCh1e-KKbOoV4/edit#) linked to the recently created [Galaxy Working Groups](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/), as these are the entry points for new community members.

To celebrate the success of GCC2021, the Freiburg Galaxy team enjoyed an outdoor BBQ!
