__Mzwanele Ngubo__ uses Galaxy for cancer research at [The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Regenerative Medicine, Ottawa (Canada)](http://www.ohri.ca/programs/regenerative_medicine/default.asp). Thanks Mzwanele!


> My research projects seek to map the epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in cancer, and delineate the higher order chromatin organization during aging. UseGalaxy.eu resources are useful in our analysis of such computationally intensive biomedical datasets. This infrastructure is quite beneficial even to research scientists without computer programming or systems administration background.
