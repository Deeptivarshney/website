Within the 1st [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/eosc-life) Training Open Call, two out of four proposals have been awarded to the
European Galaxy team to develop climate science e-learning material and mentoring and training opportunities
for our communities.

### Learn how to compose and execute repeatable and reproducible modelling workflow with ​[FATES](https://fates-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)​ for improving climate models

This course is aimed at field ecologists, environmental scientists, climate modellers and biologists interested in improving climate
models by better representing terrestrial ecosystems. FATES is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model
for use in ​[Earth System Models (ESM)](https://soccom.princeton.edu/content/what-earth-system-model-esm)
that simulates and predicts growth, death, and regeneration of plants and subsequent tree size distributions.
Participants will learn about climate modelling as well as how to use the 
[Galaxy Climate JupyterLab](https://live.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=interactive_tool_climate_notebook) for running FATES experiments and compare those with observational data.


### Open Life Science: Mentoring and Training opportunities for EOSC Research Infrastructures

[Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/) is a 16-week long personal mentorship and cohort-based training for
individuals who would like to develop and lead Open Research projects in their communities. OLS
will open a call for mentors and project leads from EOSC RIs for their third cohort, which is expected
to take place from February to May 2021. In each cohort, the participants of this program will:

- share their expertise and gain knowledge essential to create, lead, and sustain an Open
Science project
- connect with members across different projects, communities, backgrounds, and identities
- empower each other to become effective Open Science ambassadors in their communities

For more information, please contact the OLS team (​team@openlifesci.org​) or join their​ public
mailing list to receive updates.
