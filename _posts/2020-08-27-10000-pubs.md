We reached 10,000 publications in the [Galaxy Publication Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy) this month. This library tracks publications that use, extend,
implement or reference Galaxy or Galaxy-based platforms. It includes journal articles, theses, book chapters, preprints, and a couple more odds and ends.
This milestone is a good opportunity to look at what the library tells us about where the Galaxy project has been, and maybe where it's going as well.
