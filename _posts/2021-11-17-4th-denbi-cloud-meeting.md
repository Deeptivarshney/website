The [4th de.NBI Cloud User meeting](https://events.denbi.de/event/1/) took place from 12th to 24th of November 2021.

Many researchers from different bioinformatics research areas gathered to learn more about cloud computing and the de.NBI Cloud. 

The Galaxy Team contributed to the event, organizing two different workshops:
* [Bioconda and Biocontainers](https://events.denbi.de/event/1/program) - organizer: Björn Grüning
* [Deploying a compute cluster in OpenStack via Terraform](https://events.denbi.de/event/1/program) - organizer: Gianmauro Cuccuru

Both of them have garnered the interest of the cloud community.
