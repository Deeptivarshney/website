The next global climate strike will be on **March 25**! As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly: the team will be striking and **we will not schedule new jobs on the European Galaxy server during the whole day**. Running jobs will not be interrupted, but no new jobs will start to run. They will stay grey for the entire day.

We encourage all of you to join one of the huge number of strikes
[that will be taking place worldwide](https://fridaysforfuture.org/march25/) on this day!

We will be striking in [Freiburg](https://freiburgforfuture.de/25-03/), if you are nearby join us - and maybe we will find time to talk about research as well :)
