[HealthyCloud (Health Research & Innovation Cloud)](https://healthycloud.eu/) is a new European project that aims at __improving health research__ and its translation to healthcare at all levels: from public health to personalised medicine, through secondary use of health data. HealthyCloud will deliver a Strategic Agenda for the implementation of the European Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC).

Galaxy is part of the ecosystem in this project and will contribute towards reproducible analysis and help with distributed computational analysis across Europe.
