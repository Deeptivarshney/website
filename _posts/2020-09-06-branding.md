Plenty of branding material is now at your disposal thanks to the  European Galaxy Community.
You can find **logos**, **fliers**, **stickers**, **fact sheets** and many more resources in
our [branding repository](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/branding){:target="_blank"}. 

Please get in contact with us if you need printed versions of any of the assets.
And of course, feel free to use and/or adapt these resources to promote your infrastructure or foster your community! 

Thank you for using Galaxy!
