The Galaxy ecosystem is very broad in scope and reaches many audiences, each one with different needs. To provide those different profiles with the resources available, four webinars have taken place during April and May for researchers, trainers & educators, tool developers and admins & infrastructure providers.

Dave Clements presented useful [__resources for researchers__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2021-04-gr4-researchers/) on the first session: the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), the different options to run analyses and how to get support from the community.

The second session encompassed exclusively [__training__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2021-04-gr4-education/), starting with Saskia Hiltemann, who gave an overview of the use of the GTN for instructors, with some recent experiences on remote training. The rest of the webinar went all over the training stages: high-school with Christine Cucinotta, university with Miaomiao Zhou, research scientists with Subina Mehta, and the society at large with Bérénice Batut.

During the third webinar, Dan Blankenberg covered the resources for making [__tools__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2021-05-gr4-tool-devs/) available in the Galaxy ecosystem; Anthony Bretaudeau talked about "Dockerized Galaxy for Tool Publishing" and Petr Novák detailed the process to publish tools in your own public Galaxy server.

Finally, Gianmauro Cuccuru and Lucille Delisle highlighted resources for [__administering__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2021-05-gr4-admins/) everything from a public instance with thousands of registered users to a local instance at a lab.
