The __[de.NBI-Cloud](https://www.denbi.de/cloud) has extended the support to the European Galaxy Server__ by providing new computational infrastructure.

After assessing the needs of our users and analysing our current bottlenecks, we have decided to invest in __storage__, __memory extensions__ for our compute nodes and new __GPU nodes__.

If you have some special needs that we should consider in our next purchase, let us know! And please consider growing the Galaxy computational resources with the funding leftovers of your group by the end of the year.

Thanks to the BMBF and de.NBI for their constant support!
