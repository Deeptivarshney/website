5 continents, 100 countries and more than 100 industry companies using Galaxy... 4000 users trained using TIaaS and growing...!

Since the European Galaxy Server was open to the public in 2018, the number of users has increased rapidly, with around **2,000 active users per month**[^footnote]. More than **11 million jobs** have been submitted, which means that **every minute 12 jobs are finishing**!
