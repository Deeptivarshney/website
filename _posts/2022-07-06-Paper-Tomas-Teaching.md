Tomas Klingström and J.I. Ohlsson have published a [paper](https://www.wageningenacademic.com/pb-assets/wagen/WCGALP2022/39_007.pdf) about the use of BioContainers,Galaxy, and the GTN Training material for bioinformatics researchers. Congratulations to this nice publication and thanks for using the European Galaxy server and sharing your results with us!

Abstract: 
Most bioinformatics researchers create their own working environments depending on their
training, access to computing resources and what advice they receive from other researchers.
This makes the development of training programs difficult as much knowledge and work is
locked into each researcher’s unique computing environment for data analysis.
Using software container solutions such as Biocontainers and a ‘one image per task’ coding
pattern when developing a workflow, it is easy for an application expert to rewrite workflows
for research, training and dissemination of new workflows for analysing data. This paper
describes the reasoning behind this approach which is now being tested in a collaboration
between livestock researchers in Sweden and South Africa.
