More than 20 researchers with diverse backgrounds participated in the virtual __Galaxy Metabolomics Mini-Symposium__. The presentations covered diverse metabolomics applications and analysis tools and their past, ongoing or future integration into the Galaxy framework. In addition, there were two discussion rounds about the user and tool developer aspects of Galaxy Metabolomics. Slides and notes of the Symposium can be found [in the Google Drive folder of the community](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V7hQN11-v3BJCwTMGMtDCjA4Gl403g99).

We identified potential overlaps in tool development and user satisfaction and agreed to have a __Galaxy Metabolomics calls every two months__. 
The __next meetings__ are planned for March 11, May 6 and at the [Galaxy Community Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) in July.
