Thanks to a great Collaboration between the Galaxy Community, [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/) and the [Workflow Hub](https://workflowhub.eu/),
it is also possible to import a
workflow directly into Galaxy and run it. This is using the [GH4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/) API [TRS](https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-service-schemas).

We have created a video showcasing the process for a COVID-19 data analysis workflow:

1. Search in the Workflow Hub and retrieve a Galaxy workflow.
2. Import it easily into Galaxy.
3. Get remote COVID-19 data into your Galaxy history.
4. Run the imported workflow on the remote data. 

You can see how it works in practice in the following video:
