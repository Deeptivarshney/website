The [GGA](https://github.com/galaxy-genome-annotation/) team has updated UseGalaxy.eu's Apollo (collaborative genome annotation editor) to 2.6.3 from 2.5.0. Check out the changelog copied below.

Not yet using apollo for your genome annotation needs? Come talk to us as [GCC2021](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/) where we'll have a couple of training modules covering the system's use.


## 2.6.3

Features

- Added ability to use posts to sequence methods [2555](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/pull/2558).
- Added system info web service [2557](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/pull/2557).
