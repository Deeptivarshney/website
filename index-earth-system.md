# Welcome to Galaxy for Earth System and environment
<img src="assets/media/earth_system_background.png" alt="Fair-Ease project"/>

<br>
Galaxy for Earth System and environment was implemented within the project [**Fair-Ease**](https://fairease.eu/){:target="_blank"}. It's a virtual platform to process, analyse and visualize Earth System, Environment and Biodiversity data. It is based on the [Galaxy framework](https://galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"}, which guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses independent of command-line knowledge.

# Training

We are working in close collaboration with the [__Galaxy Training Network (GTN)__](https://training.galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"} to develop training materials of data analyses based on Galaxy. If you want to know more about the GTN or how to become part of the Galaxy community, check the videos below!

**Training material**

All relevant materials for Earth System, Environment and Biodiversity data analysis will be available within the GTN.

# Workflows

To orchestrate tools and help users with their analyses, several [workflows](https://galaxyproject.org/learn/advanced-workflow/){:target="_blank"} will be available. They formally orchestrate tools in a defined order and with defined parameters, but they are customizable (tools, order, parameters).
